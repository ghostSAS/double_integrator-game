# game: control a double integrator
A simple game lets you control a double integrator model
$\dot{x}_1(t) &= x_2(t) \\
    \dot{x}_2(t) &= u(t)$
You are expected to steer the system to the target by providing different inputs


### Installation
- download the code to the local
- run in Matlab (tested version on 2021a)

### How to play
- drag the slider on the right to steer the system to the target presented as a green circle in the center
